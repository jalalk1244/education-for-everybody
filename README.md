# Education for EVERYBODY (EFE)
According to statistics, countries with a high poverty rate also have very low literacy rate and enrolled children in schools. Poverty is the reason that quality education is a distant dream for a lot of children that live in these countries. Education for EVERYBODY (EFE) is a donation site for people with compassion who want to help these children utilise their right for education and people who want to make a difference by their donations. EFE sees itself as a reliable and secure link between the donors and the children in need. This is because one of our core principle is that all of the donation money, 100% uncut, will go to bringing quality education for children who cannot afford it.
